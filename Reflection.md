1.Can I explain what my code does?

My code is an HTML document that represents a personal resume. It contains various sections, including a header with my name, an About Me section with a brief introduction, a Skills section with a list of programming languages and other skills, an Education section with my diploma information, an Experience section with my work experience, a Profile picture section with links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, a Skills Icon section with an SVG icon, and a References section with quotes from notable individuals.


2.What was my coding process?

When creating my resume, I followed a structured approach. Here's how I did it:

Planning: I started by planning the overall structure and content of my resume. I decided on the sections I wanted to include and the information I wanted to present in each section.
HTML markup: I wrote the HTML code to create the basic structure of my resume, using elements like header, section, h1, p, ul, and li.
Content addition: I added the content to each section, including text, images, and links.
Accessibility features: I added aria-label attributes to provide accessibility features for screen readers.
Testing and refinement: I tested my code in a web browser and refined it as needed to ensure that it displayed correctly and was accessible.


3.What challenges did I have?

The challenges i faced : 
As with any coding project, I encountered warnings and errors that needed to be fixed. I had to use my problem-solving skills to identify the issues and come up with solutions.
Finally, I faced the challenge of managing my time effectively. I had to balance the need to complete the project with the need to learn new skills and technologies.
Overall, these challenges helped me grow as a developer


What would I do differently now?

I would break down my code into smaller, more modular components, making it easier to maintain and update individual sections of my resume without affecting the rest of the code.

I would add more personal touches to my resume, such as a brief summary or objective statement, to give potential employers a better sense of who I am and what I can bring to their organization.
